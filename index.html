Rawr!! I'm Dennis the Dinosaur. I'm one of the last remaining dinosaur, and the rest of my species went extinct 65 million years ago.  
I'm usually not a competitive dinosaur, but my neighbor,<abbr title="Peter">Pete</abbr> the Velociraptor keeps saying he was the most feared dinosaur. So we are both trying to set this conflict and decide who's the scariest? Me or the pesky Velociraptors?
We are both going to tell a little bit about ourselves and you can decide for yourself.</p>
<p>
Thanks for the introduction Dennis. <i>sigh</i> Anyway, as Dennis was saying, I'm Peter the Velociraptor. We are much faster and of course smarter. We hunt in packs. In groups, I'm sure we could take 
anyone out. I mean just watch the movie Jurassic Park. <i> laughs</i> And we can't forget about my two claws on my feet! It literally looks like a <b>sickle</b>, and it could 
carve anything. We are also great scavengers. And of course, based off our <strong>size</strong>, we could survive longer because we are much smaller and don't stand out like some dinosaurs over here. <i> cough cough dennis cough cough</i></p>
<p>
Alright well now, it's my turn. I'm Dennis of course, and I think I'm the most <del>feared</del><ins>terrifying</ins> dinosaur. I'm big, and I have razor sharp teeth. I could probably fight any dinosaur off, don't need no group to <b>back me up!</b> I have the most powerful bite out of any other dinosaur. My short arms 
look like a weakness, but longer arms are so <b>overrated</b>. Longer arms are vulnerable to disease, and could get broken, so I would take my shorter arms
any day of the week. I made this table right <a HREF="Differences.html">here</a> to show the differences much easier. So now it's your job to figure out who's the scariest dinosaur. 
I will provide one more table to include some more info I could not fit in our paragraphs.
